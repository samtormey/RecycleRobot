Stuff to work for our team

RealOptimalPath: The first two time steps are the same

goal2belt: work on discretization of the cartesian points on the belt to better match the discretization of the robot arm
- Work on having the arm recognize objects outside of the current range ahead of time. ie
if there is an object out of reach that will come into reach the arm can swing by early
and pick it up

control_to_position: Maybe switch from Runge-Kutta to Forward Euler so its more consistent with RealOptimalPath
