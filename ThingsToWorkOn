Stuff to work for our team

RealOptimalPath: The first two time steps are the same

goal2belt: work on discretization of the cartesian points on the belt to better match the discretization of the robot arm

control_to_position: Maybe switch from Runge-Kutta to Forward Euler so its more consistent with RealOptimalPath
