Intro and motivation for problem (recycling, replacing tedious jobs for human workers, incentivizing recycling through efficiency). 

General summary of what we plan to do (have QR codes taped to pucks sliding along a conveyor belt, to be grabbed with maximum efficiency by a Scara robot). 

Decision making algorithm theory

Minimum time robot path theory

Implementation of MATLAB with fmincon. 
--> How we plan to improve our existing computer code in the future

Potential future work: Temporal goal planning, a synthesis of decision making & minimum time.
